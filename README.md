# Game Sales Data Analytics Case Study
Welcome to the Game Sales Data Analytics Case Study repository! This repository houses a comprehensive data analysis project based on the [RevoU data analytics mini-course](https://revou.co/mini-course-data-analytics){:target="_blank"}. In this case study, I delve into the exciting world of game sales, aiming to extract insights and answers from a dataset containing valuable information about various video games.

### **Case Study Overview:**
In this project, I tackle several intriguing questions related to game sales using a dataset provided in both raw and cleaned formats. The key questions we seek to answer include:
1. Identifying the oldest and newest games in the dataset.
2. Determining the publisher responsible for the highest number of games.
3. Pinpointing the developer that created most games and identifying the highest-selling game series.
4. Identifying the series with the most extensive collection of games.
